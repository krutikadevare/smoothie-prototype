# Smoothie UI Prototype

This is a beginner project that hosts my **Smoothie UI prototype** from Figma.  
The prototype is shown on a webpage with a simple gradient background, glass-style frame, and loading spinner.

## How It Works
- Designed in **Figma**  
- Embedded in HTML using an `<iframe>`  
- Hosted online using **GitHub Pages**

## Tools
- Figma  
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- GitHub Pages

## What I Learned
Prototyping lets you **test designs and user flows** without writing full code.  
It helps you see how an app or website will work before building it fully.
